# DependencyIQ

**Know your dependencies. Secure your software.**

DependencyIQ helps development teams gain full visibility into their software supply chain — tracking dependencies, surfacing vulnerabilities, and delivering actionable intelligence to keep codebases healthy and secure.

## What We Do

- 🔍 **Dependency Discovery** — Automatically identify and catalog all direct and transitive dependencies across your projects.
- 🛡️ **Vulnerability Intelligence** — Stay ahead of known CVEs and emerging threats with continuously updated security advisories.
- 📊 **Risk Insights** — Understand the risk profile of your dependency graph with clear, prioritized reporting.
- 🔄 **Continuous Monitoring** — Get notified when new vulnerabilities are disclosed for dependencies already in use.
